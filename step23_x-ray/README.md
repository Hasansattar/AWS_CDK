# AWS X-Ray

## Introduction

AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application, and shows a map of your application’s underlying components. You can use X-Ray to analyze both applications in development and in production, from simple three-tier applications to complex microservices applications consisting of thousands of services.

## How does AWS X-Ray works?

#### X-Ray helps answer three critical questions

1. **How** is my application doing?
2. **Why** is my application performing the way it is?
3. **Who** is impacted by the issues?

## Service graph

X-Ray uses the data that your application sends to generate a service graph. Each AWS resource that sends data to X-Ray appears as a service in the graph. [Edges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_Edge.html) connect the services that work together to serve requests. Edges connect clients to your application, and your application to the downstream services and resources that it uses.

#### Service graph data is retained for 30 days.

## Traces

A trace ID tracks the path of a request through your application. A trace collects all the segments generated by a single request. That request is typically an HTTP GET or POST request that travels through a load balancer, hits your application code, and generates downstream calls to other AWS services or external web APIs. The first supported service that the HTTP request interacts with adds a trace ID header to the request, and propagates it downstream to track the latency, disposition, and other request data.

## Segments

The compute resources running your application logic send data about their work as segments. A segment provides the resource's name, details about the request, and details about the work done. For example, when an HTTP request reaches your application, it can record the following data about.

- The host – hostname, alias or IP address
- The request – method, client address, path, user agent
- The response – status, content
- The work done – start and end times, subsegments
- Issues that occur – errors, faults and exceptions, including automatic capture of exception stacks.
