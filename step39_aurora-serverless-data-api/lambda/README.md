# Amazon RDS Data Service
Amazon RDS provides an HTTP endpoint to run SQL statements on an Amazon Aurora Serverless DB cluster. To run these statements, you work with the Data Service API.
By using the Data API for Aurora Serverless, you can work with a web-services interface to your Aurora Serverless DB cluster. The Data API doesn't require a persistent connection to the DB cluster. Instead, it provides a secure HTTP endpoint and integration with AWS SDKs. You can use the endpoint to run SQL statements without managing connections.
